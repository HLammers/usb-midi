''' Multi-port USB MIDI 1.0 library for MicroPython based on a multiple MIDI Streaming interface approach

    Multiple MIDI ports set up this way are recognized by Windows and Linux and shoud work on macOS as well (not tested)
    Port names are ignored by Windows, but shown by Linux and might be shown by macOS (not tested)
    If usb.device is initiatied with builtin_driver=True this approach doesnâ€™t work with windows (with or without names assigned)
    If port names are defined, these need to be longer than one character, otherwise Windows draws a GeneralFailure error (this might be either
    a Windows quirk or a bug in machine.USBDevice)
    
    This library is still in testing phase and further development might introduce breaking changes

    Requires the micropython-lib usb-device library (https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/micropython/usb) and
    replaces the micropython-lib usb-device-midi library (which only supports a single port)
